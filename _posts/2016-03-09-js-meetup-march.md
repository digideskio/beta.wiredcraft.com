## Lightning talks featuring YOU!

Lightning talks are an opportunity for you to share a personal project, idea or theory with the community. If you are interested in speaking at one you can just let the event organizers know at the event or you can email the event organizers in advance. 

If you'd like to speak at a future Meetup or have suggestion for next venue, you can talk to Coco (coco@wiredcraft.com).
